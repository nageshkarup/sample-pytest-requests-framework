# API Test Automation Framework

This project is an API test automation framework built using `pytest` and `requests`. It automates testing against the JSONPlaceholder API. The framework ensures users from the city `FanCode` have completed more than half of their todo tasks, and includes additional tests for posts and other endpoints.

## Features
- **Reusable API Client**: Easily interact with multiple endpoints like `/todos`, `/users`, `/posts`, etc.
- **Service Classes**: Encapsulates business logic for `users`, `posts`, and more.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Tests can be extended for other API interactions.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Detailed logging and HTML test reports.
- **Easy to Extend**: Flexible enough to accommodate new API endpoints and test cases.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` for package management

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

   cd sample-pytest-requests-framework

2. Create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv .venv

    (macOS and Linux)
    source .venv/bin/activate

    (Windows)
    .venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the tests:
